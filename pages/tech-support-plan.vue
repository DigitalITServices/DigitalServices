                    Technology should empower your business, not keep you awake at night worrying about what might go wrong. Every business owner knows the dread of technical issues 
                    striking at the worst possible moment, websites crashing during busy periods, email systems failing before important pitches, or key software behaving mysteriously when 
                    deadlines loom. The Tech Peace of Mind Plan ensures you're never stranded when technology lets you down.
